  <h>The Key by the Bridge</h>

  <p>
    One sunny afternoon, Mia decided to explore the woods behind her grandmother's house. 
    <ul>
      <li>She had always been curious about the old stone bridge</li>
      <li>she could see from the kitchen window.</li> 
      <li>As  she approached it, she noticed a small, sparkling object lying in the grass.</li>
    </ul>  
  </p>
  <p>
    Picking it up, she discovered it was an intricately carved silver key. Intrigued, she looked around and spotted a rusty, locked chest half-buried near the bridge. 
    Her heart raced as she inserted the key into the lock. With a satisfying click, the lid creaked open, revealing a treasure trove of letters and trinkets that seemed to tell a forgotten tale.
    The End
